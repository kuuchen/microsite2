			about Venice Biannale 2018
		</p>
		<p>
			This years’ curators of the 16th International Architecture Exhibition, Yvonne Farrell and Shelley McNamara titled the 16th International Architecture Exhibition  Freespace, and explained their choice with the following words:
		</p>
		<p>
			Freespace describes a generosity of spirit and a sense of humanity at the core of architecture's agenda, focusing on the quality of space itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Freespace focuses on architecture’s ability to provide free and additional spatial gifts to those who use it and on its ability to address the unspoken wishes of strangers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Freespace celebrates architecture’s capacity to find additional and unexpected generosity in each project - even within the most private, defensive, exclusive or commercially restricted conditions.
		</p>
		<p>

			about "No More Free Space?", Singapore Pavilion
		</p>
		<p>
			The Singapore Pavilion addresses this year’s biennale titled ‘freespace’ by asking if there is really ‘no more free space?’ in the island country, as a testimony of how the creative freedom of mind has the power to turn space constraints into a myriad of alternative possibilities.
		</p>
		<p>
			Curated by the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) in collaboration with the National University of Singapore’s Department of Architecture (NUS), the exhibition features 12 Singapore-based projects and an immersive centrepiece that tells the story of how, in spite of the lack of free space, Singapore-based architects, urban planners and place-makers have creatively found ways to bring delightful free spaces to the city’s everyday life. The projects on show tap into social capital in order to bring joy and connect people to the larger community. The Singapore Pavilion is commissioned by the DesignSingapore Council (DSG) of the Ministry of Communications and Information, and the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).
		</p>
		<p class="bottom">
			Complete with lights, scent, sounds and images of Singapore, the pavilion invites visitors to experience the spaces within the cloud and interact with the installation through a series of scented, translucent ceramic end-pieces that glow when they sense proximity. The pavilion is an example of a resourceful, unexpected free space, designed to reach beyond physical constraints and instead, engage with the qualities of space-making that celebrate generosity and humanity through our senses.

			the Pavilion's centrepiece
		</p>
		<p class="bottom">
			The Pavilion’s centrepiece features an immersive, multi-sensory installation, a suspended transparent cloud made of handcrafted acrylic knots. The cloud is programmed to transmit light from above, shifting in color and intensity to complement projected videos of Singapore’s built environment below. By trapping, bending, and transmitting, the cloud creates an immersive environment and is a visual spectacle.

			The exhibition features 12 Singapore-based projects that showcase the resourcefulness of architects to turn constraints into possibilities. More than 400 times smaller than Italy, Singapore has turned its lack of space into an opportunity to re-imagine what a highly compact city can be.
